    Summary:
    We're convinced that doing this topic is meaningful due to the increasing need for business to provide constant support for their customers. Industries such as education, medicine, and mobile (personal assistants) are all implementing conversational interfaces/bots in order to fulfil specific business needs. As conversational bots become more prevalent in different industries new software architectures will be developed based on these needs there is an increasing need to study different software architectures specific to conversational bots in order to effectively implement these solutions in the real world. Additionally as business are removing the need for GUI's with auditory conversational interfaces/bots a whole host of human-computer interaction challenges. 

    Pros:
    The pros of choosing conversional interfaces/bots for a seminar topic are that certain applications of conversational interfaces/bots are highly developed and the industry has a mature understanding of how these technologies should be used in these contexts. Additionally conversational bots are an attractive field of study so there's on going research being published about this topic that's easily accessible from ACM, google scholar, etc.

    Cons:
    There are specific applications of conversational interface/bots that are emerging that may have less conclusive evidence for certain claims. Topics like this would likely stem from applications such as conversational bots application in fields such as psychology and medicine. Additionally the field of conversational bots can get highly technical quickly as the software architecture revolves highly around the specific algorithms that are being utilized to perform tasks such as NLP, CI, etc. For an overview of conversational interfaces/bots looking at these technologies from a high level will likely be necessary.
