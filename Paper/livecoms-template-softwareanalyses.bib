abstract="The use of chatbots evolved rapidly in numerous fields in recent years, including Marketing, Supporting Systems, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, and Entertainment. In this paper, we first present a historical overview of the evolution of the international community's interest in chatbots. Next, we discuss the motivations that drive the use of chatbots, and we clarify chatbots' usefulness in a variety of areas. Moreover, we highlight the impact of social stereotypes on chatbots design. After clarifying necessary technological concepts, we move on to a chatbot classification based on various criteria, such as the area of knowledge they refer to, the need they serve and others. Furthermore, we present the general architecture of modern chatbots while also mentioning the main platforms for their creation. Our engagement with the subject so far, reassures us of the prospects of chatbots and encourages us to study them in greater extent and depth.",
